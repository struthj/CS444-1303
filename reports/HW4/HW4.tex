	Our fourth project involves implementing a best fit allocation algorithm.
	This document takes you through the process of designing and implementing our SLAB best fit algorithm, and comparing the efficiency of first fit vs best fit algorithms.

%Answer the following questions in sufficient detail:
%1) What do you think the main point of this assignment is?

\section{Project 4 Questions}
\subsection{Question 1}
The main point of this assignment is to take our understanding of how memory works, and build on it by looking into how the Linux kernel uses the Simple list of blocks (SLOB) memory allocator and how it compares to a best-fit algorithm like the SLAB memory allocator. Then we will compare fragmentation to find the efficiency of each algorithm. We will also use system calls to track memory usage.

%2) How did you personally approach the problem? Design decisions, algorithm, etc.
\subsection{Question 2}


%3) How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details, for instance.
\subsection{Question 3}

%4) What did you learn?
\subsection{Question 4}
In this project we learned a lot more about how the kernel handles memory allocation and how efficient best-fit memory allocation is to first fit. We also learned how to use system calls to track memory usage in the kernel. We learned that the first fit algorithm although simple is very inefficient (We had 8 percent efficiency), and that best-fit is much more efficient (We had 96 percent efficiency). This final assignment built on our previous knowledge of creating patches for the kernel as well.
